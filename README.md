# MSAL SSO

The MSAL SSO repository is made up of two Angular applications (foo & bar).  Both applications are identical 
and both use the Microsoft Authentication Library (msal) for authentication.  Each application has a login page, 
a dashboard page and a detail page. The dashboard has a list of college football teams and when you select a team in 
the list you are taken to the second application's detail page.  MSAL will log you in automatically behind the scenes,
and you are taken to the correct detail page for the selected team.
